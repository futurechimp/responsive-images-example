This project is a chopped-down version of the Filament Group's responsive images example - specifically, the data-attribute-based branch. It's an exercise in choosing which image to serve to a client based on device capabilities.  Large-screen devices presumably have more bandwidth, so they get the full-sized image (big.jpg). Small-screen devices are likely to be mobile, and can't display the large image properly anyway, so they get the small image (small.jpg).

This code is substantially similar to the original Filament Group code, but is boiled down to the simplest format we could make it. We needed to change a few things about the Filamental HTML, which in our tests caused the base-tag rewrite to occur at the wrong time, negating the image-rewriting interactions between client and server.

You can simply put this on any Apache server, and change the base.href on line 13 of index.html to point at the fully-qualified domain name of your server. Assuming your Apache vhost allows the use of .htaccess files, everything should work, if you're using a new/sexy browser.  Firefox 3.x, IE < 8 don't work, for sure.  

To test it out, take a look at the HTTP requests and responses using something like HTTPFox. You should see requests for the 1-pixel .gifs, then *either* the big.jpg *or* the small.jpg depending on how large your screen size is.
